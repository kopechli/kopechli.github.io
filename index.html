                A web developer based out of Thessaloniki the second biggest town of Greece.
                Τhat said, my name as you see is lengthy. So...<br><br> ...var kopechli = Konstantinos Pechlivanidis;<br><br>
                The latin translation of my name is <span title="Like the movie">Constantine</span>.<br><br> 
                I was born on a winter of 1987 and as a child i didn’t had <span title="My toys were disassembled :)">broken toys</span> or imaginary friends.<br><br> 
                In school i had stable grades always in the good territory, not perfect not bad, but <u>good!</u> <br><br>
                <q style="font-size: x-large;padding: 10px">The perfect is the enemy of the good.</q><br>
                <span>~Voltaire</span><br><br>
                I studied information management in college because i like, systems.
                My interest in systems expands from natural to artificial , from sociology and behavior to all kinds of 
                networks and the information they are transmitting.<br><br>
                After college i enrolled in the military, where i learned some other interesting systems , models and behaviors.
                I graduated from signals and communications school and i was discharged as a second lieutenant.<br><br>
                My personality type is INTP, and my brain is thinking through visual processing. I love technology and art since i can remember. 
                People usually describe me as introvert with self harming honesty, i am extrovert with friends 
                and i have a innate passion for how things work.<br><br>
                Ιn the years i have been in this world, i distilled three basic things about life :

            <h1>The Algorithms</h1>
                <p>In 6th grade i was saving money from a zero allowance! To buy popular science, Focus or PC Magazine.
                At that point, i had a broken keyboard i found in a dumpster and i was pretending, typing on it.
                Those days, children were sent to computer schools, to get a diploma in computers. We were poor so my 
                older brother was the one that got to go to computer school.</p> 
                <p>I learned about operating systems and Pascal from his notes.
                I was a dyslexic kid that gaved away his right to oral exams to compete in equal plane with the other students. 
                By high school no one knew and no one can tell that i was dyslexic. I didn’t need therapy or doctors, because 
                i treated it like handicap and a head start for the others, i always played in hard mode.
                I got a card from my local area library and started reading like no one else. I probably read the entire 
                library by the end of the high school. I was kenny, no matter what, i am coming back! That is the mentality developed in me, at that time.</p>
                <p>My journey in the software development world started in high school when i was introduced to algorithms. 
                I excelled in computers and communication technology classes, although i did not had a PC at home. 
                And when i got one(after working at a factory), i disappeared. After the relentless, gaming like theres 
                no tomorrow(Diablo II) phase pased, i started breaking and fixing the operating system and subsequently learning and
                i was buying 56 kbps dial up internet line when i had the money to explore the internet.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="timeline-item" id='On&#160;The&#160;Road'>
            <h1>The Programming Langues</h1>
                <p>I graduated from high school in my 17 and i knew that i wanted to go with the information technology sector.
                I got in Technological Educational Institute of Kavala. In Greece we have a Pan-national competition for the open positions in universities.</p>
                <p>After the registration, I got there again, when the first classes started. I was working and saving money until then! I had nowhere to stay, I had nobody and i knew nothing about the city.
                Yet again i was the outsider! In threre i official learned programing in C++, Java, SQL. Web development in html / css, php, javascript and Tcl !
                And When you poor, you learn to fix things!<br>
                I graduated:</p>

            <h1>Work Market</h1>
            <p> I am ready to start , that is what i was thinking! But according to others i wasn't.
                With in an underdeveloped industry with no work experience in the sector, no connections 
                and with nobody willing to hire a greenhorn. I ended up working as ICT help desk agent.
                I remembered my professor's word of advice,one of those days, "Get the f.. out of here if you can!"
                I go from agent to floor assistant to back-office in 7 months and all that with the same pay! 
                Oh and i was making visits to other departments as pc technician to!</p>
            <p> I finished there and i spent a year trying to find a job! So, i decided i will work for the army 
                instead of doing a compulsory service! With my background i can get in easy! I thought.
                They told me that the signals and communication is very difficult position to get in. 
                There was only 8 position for the entire country, if i am not from a military or political family, 
                i do not have a chance and that i need to pass the physicals and the athletic exams first.
                I am Kenny! </p>

            <h1>It ain't over till it's over</h1>
                <p>So... i am discharged from the army as a signals and communications second lieutenant and i am full of confidence (military can do that to you).
                I am contemplating my next steps, i familiarize myself with the new technologies in web development, for a moment it felt like, it was right! 
                BUT... i am after all Kenny. My father diagnosed with C(a bad one),my grandpa need of constant monitoring and and visits to doctor after 
                a life threatening surgery he had, my mother suffered a nervous breakdown and i ended up collecting the pieces.</p>
                <p>Between ERs, chemotherapy session, psychiatric hospitals, doctor visitation and microbiology laboratories, let's say my life was static.
                In 2018 my father's suffering ended, i managed to fix most of the pieces and by the end of the year i was working at a car wash! But i was 
                happy , because i started working again. In 2019 i managed to re enter the web development sector and in 2020 i am a collateral damage.
                <b>I am Kenny!</b> </p>
